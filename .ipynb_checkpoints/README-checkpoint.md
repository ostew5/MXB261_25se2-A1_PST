# Problem-Solving Task: MXB261_25se1

## What you need to do

This assessment task requires you to create a MATLAB code and write a report and responses to task layed out in the assessment task sheet. This will involve writing code and using theory from the pre-recorded lectures in Weeks 1-5. More details (including allocation of marks) will be provided closer to the release date.

## What to submit

A PDF version of the report needs to be submitted through Canvas containing also your code as part of that PDF, and separately your runnable code as Matlab .m files to be submitted through Canvas by the due date deadline of 11:59pm Friday 29th of August. 

**Feedback:**

Under normal circumstances, you will receive marks for each criterion via a Canvas rubric within 10-15 working days of submission. Click on Grades to see your results. Usually the reason for each choice of mark is self-evident, the marker will include some written feedback about your performance. You should use this feedback to strengthen your performance in the next assessment item.  

**Moderation:**

All staff who are assessing your work meet to discuss and compare their judgements before marks or grades are finalised.
